# mechlens

Mechanistic-interpretability tracing for `gemma-2-2b` under TransformerLens.

Generate token by token, capture the residual stream at every layer, then run
enrichment passes over the saved trace — SAE features now, logit lens and
attribution next.

## Setup

```bash
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
huggingface-cli login   # gemma is gated: accept the license at hf.co/google/gemma-2-2b
```

## Use

Everything runs from `backend/`:

```bash
python -m app.cli trace -p "The Golden Gate Bridge is located in the city of" -n 20
python -m app.cli enrich traces/<id>.json --sae     # SAE features, no model load
python -m app.cli show traces/<id>.json --layer 20
python -m app.cli trace -p "2 + 2 =" -n 8 --sae     # or do both at once
```

A trace is two files that travel together:

| file | what |
| --- | --- |
| `<id>.json` | the `Trace` document — tokens, next-token distributions, per-layer state |
| `<id>.residuals.npy` | `[n_tokens, n_layers, d_model]` float32 residual stream (`hook_resid_post`) |

Splitting them is what makes `enrich` cheap: a pass reads the tensor off disk and
never touches gemma, so iterating on pass code costs seconds instead of a
generation run.

```python
from app.store import load
trace, residuals = load("traces/golden-gate.json")   # mmap=True to page it in lazily
residuals[7, 11]                                     # token 7, layer 11 -> [d_model]
trace.steps[7].layers[11].features                   # its top SAE features
```

## Layout

| module | role |
| --- | --- |
| `app/schema.py` | the trace schema — the JSON contract everything writes into |
| `app/capture.py` | phase 1: token-by-token loop, residual stream cached at every layer |
| `app/passes/sae.py` | phase 2: Gemma Scope SAE features per (token, layer) |
| `app/passes/__init__.py` | the `Pass` protocol — take a trace + residuals, fill fields |
| `app/store.py` | save/load: JSON document plus its `.npy` sidecar |
| `app/model_cache.py` | one model per process (loading gemma costs ~6s) |
| `app/sae_cache.py` | one SAE per layer per process (~302MB each at 16k) |
| `app/cli.py` | `trace` / `enrich` / `show` |

`LayerState.logit_lens` and `.edges` are defined and empty — phases 3 and 4 fill
them on traces that already exist.

## Tests

```bash
pytest backend/tests -q            # ~7s: a 1M-param model on CPU, and a stand-in SAE
MECHLENS_SLOW=1 pytest backend/tests -q   # adds a real Gemma Scope SAE (302MB download)
```
